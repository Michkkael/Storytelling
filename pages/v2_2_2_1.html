<p>After a few days of researches, Blue finally finds a trusted person, Red, who knows a lot about the Irish mafia. He is actually a former member of this clan and now, he is on parole and  in a protective custody program. A  few years earlier, Red used to be an informer for the DEA.</p>
<p>Blue decides to make a phone call to Red in order to make an appointment and to talk about this Irish Mafia. He dials the number and places the phone to his ear. Red picks up the phone immediately without telling a word. Blue can hear his warm and strong breathing from the phone. “Red?” Blue asks. “Who’s asking?” Red replies briefly. So Blue introduces himself and reveals his request. Red takes a breath and says “Café , 72 Grove Street, at 9 PM” and hangs up.</p>
<p>Blue is now in a taxi, going to this address. Blue is worried and thinks “can I make it?”. He imagines a big plot. And what if this man was also involved? “Sir? We are arrived…” the taxi driver says. Blue pays what he owes and leaves the car. He walks to the café  and sits at  an empty table. Blue is looking for Red and he looks at the door. An old man arrives in the café  and looks at Blue briefly. Is it him? No it’s not him… Blue turns his head and he suddenly sees someone in front of him. “I’m Red, what do you want?” Red says. Surprised, Blue answers with difficulty “I’m Blue, a detective and I would like to learn more about a man. I think he’s a mafia member”. Then he describes White, particularly his scars. I know him, Red replies, it’s a really mad man and I have already heard that he escaped from an asylum and he is currently searched by the police in secret. Some say he is schizophrenic and sometimes he pretends to be his own brother. In fact, he killed his brother when he was just a kid and he has developed a strong complex. Blue understands now what he couldn’t before. “White and Black are just the same person” Blue thinks.</p>
<p>Suddenly, customers in the café  are screaming. White is at the entrance with a submachine gun. He has a dark look and he walks to Blue and Red fastly. Brown comes also into the café  and screams “No, White ! Blue, run ! Run !”. So Blue stands up and he starts running . He sees White shooting on Red. Blue is having the fright of his lifetime . Brown screams “Hold on Blue ! It was a joke!”.</p>
<p>So Blue stops and looks at the scene. Everybody is laughing out loud, including Red who is in good  shape. It was just a joke for the five years work anniversary of Blue. Red is not dead, it was just fake blood and a fake submachine gun. Blue who was wrecked by this story is now wrecked by this joke. It was a bad idea.</p>
