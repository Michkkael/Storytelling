<h2>A moonlight shadow</h2>
<p>White’s district is a luxurious area, far from the center of New York, sheltered from trees, in a serene and calm place. At first look, the place looks beautiful and nice, especially at this time of the night. Blue walks down the street lit up by Haussman street lights.</p>
<p>White lives in 2145 Norman Way. Blue decides to start his investigations further, in other streets. The area is dense, Blue thinks. No need to look so close at Mr White. But the investigation doesn’t lead very far. Mr White is a very charming person, someone says. Never gets any complaints about him, I find him very quiet, just a bit reserved, someone else says. What exciting pieces of information! That does not interest Blue. Annoyed after leaving Mr Purple, the last neighbor that he has seen, Blue is sitting on the sidewalk. He is looking at the moon, when suddenly a car passes by and stops a few meters further. Blue recognizes Black’s silhouette and therefore decides to approach the car. Hidden into the shade of a plane tree, Blue clearly sees out Black’s face, illuminated by a street light. Finally, this day is not so unsuccessful as that, Blue thinks.</p>
<p>Black walks to the reception of what appears to be a block party and it is then that the receptionist gives him a Venice mask, as commonly used at disguised parties. There is a brief discussion with the receptionist which seems to laugh at a joke. Then he welcomes him and Black enters the house. A disguised party, Blue says. This may be my chance! Blue decides to go and see the receptionist, who asks his name. Risking it all, Blue gives the name of White, the receptionist looks in its registry and after a few minutes Blue can go inside. “A little too reserved that Mr White”, Blue notes with a smile while entering the house lit by beautiful candles. Ambient heat literally grabs Blue. The room is plunged into semi-darkness. There, Blue can not recognize White, even if he is having him standing in front of him. However, observing the crowd around him, he recognizes the so singular suit of Mr Black.</p>
<p>And that's when Blue is heading towards Black to learn more about him and discover more about White. But Black also moves toward the bar. After twenty minutes Blue finally gets close to Black and invites him to have a drink. Black thanks Blue and asks him his name. Blue answers his name is White. Black is pleased to see him. Ah, White, my friend ! Please quickly finish your glass, I have something to show you, Black says. Black heads to a room and he motions Blue to follow him… Arriving into the room, Blue is shocked to discover an inexhaustible cocaine shipment. And it is at this moment that the two characters start talking about the so-called business they are supposed to have together.</p>
