<p>Blue takes the file in his hands. He hesitates to open it at his desk. On the file he recognizes the Brown’s handwriting next to the photo of Black. Suddenly, a fear is overwhelming him. What if he was being watched by his mentor? Then, he decides to go home, to open the file. All the way long, in his car, Blue doesn’t feel good. The desire to confide him to Brown takes him. He hesitates for a long time and decides finally to open the file, when on his own at home.</p>
<p>Trembling, he finally opens the famous file. He reads it several times before realizing what he has just read. Black and White is the same person, affected of schizophrenia. Blue is starting to understand the meaning of White’s mission.</p>
<p>Black is in fact a dangerous criminal who acts mainly at night and White a married business man. White has hired Blue to investigate on Black because he is suspecting his wife to have an affair with Black. But how and why is Brown implied?  I understand better now, the actions of Black which were strange. And the reason why White has hired me. Blue walks round and round in his place during several hours. He builds up more and more crazy, strange, and improbable theories to try to understand the link between his mentor Brown and this mentally ill person Black or White.</p>
<p>All these reflections make him sick. The fatigue begins to take over him. He decides to have a shower. When he sees his face into the mirror, he realizes that this story is driving him crazy, and he needs to finish this case.
But I need a bath first. He enters the bathtub, hoping relaxing will help him bring some sense into him. Just five minutes in the hot water when he falls into sleep from fatigue into the bath.</p>
<p>By waking up, Blue realizes that he has slept more than 8 hours in this bathtub. The water is cold and his skin crumpled. Getting out of his bath takes him time because his muscles are stiffened. He gets dressed quickly to avoid catching a cold.</p>
<p>Once he has recovered and eaten a bit, Blue takes his car and leaves, determined to get  explanations from his mentor and answers to this questions: “Why have Brown and Black met at the restaurant?”</p>
<p>When getting in front of Brown’s house, his heart is accelerating. Fear is overwhelming him again. But his determination is stronger; he will ring the bell at Brown’s door which he has so many times gone through.</p>
<p>After a long time waiting, Brown opens the door to him. Blue cannot resist punching him into the face. Brown is stunned and surprised for a moment. He quickly recovers and knows the reason why Blue has come: White and, or Black. Keep calm and let me explain the story to you, Brown says. Blue is surprised by the reaction of his mentor. He enters the house and takes a sit into the lounge.</p>
