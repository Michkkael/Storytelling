<p>Blue is awake, he can finally open his eyes. It’s painful but he can. He is slowly coming back to life. Where am I? Blue identifies the objects around him. He knows this environment because he lives there. He is on the couch of his living room. He still feels dizzy, he tries to remember. And as he tries to move, he realises that he is tied. Blue is panicking. He can’t think properly. Maybe another effect of the poison Brown gave him…</p>
<p>A door slams. Blue can’t see what is happening. He tries to move, to shout… He gets slapped in the face from behind. Blue is terrified. He feels that somebody is trying to get him sit on his couch. He is finally in front of those men. Black, Brown and White are sitting in front of Blue. White doesn’t look the same anymore, it’s him, it’s his voice, but this time he is not disguised. Blue is half surprised to discover that. He knew something was wrong with him. But what he didn’t expect is that White is actually really scary. He has tatoos on his face, scars everywhere, his eyes are sharp, he doesn’t seem to be really strong, but he looks crazy and the grin he has on his face when he looks at Blue is insane.</p>
<p>Brown is speaking now. He tells Blue the story about how he has never been a real private, and about where the three of them are coming from : Russia. This was it, they were a small sleeper cell of the russian mafia. While Brown explains all of this, Blue keeps an eye on White because he really seems to have some mental disorder, or at least some murderous tendencies. Suddenly he thinks of Black. Black seemed to be someone normal during the tail job, what is Black doing right now? Blue is looking at Black. Black is about to set Blue’s house on fire. He just broke the gas pipe in the kitchen and now the whole room is smelling the unusual chemical stench of gas.</p>
<p>Brown continues his explanations and comes to the most important part : their goal. The russian mafia is out of money. They need people to buy their drugs and weapons, but since the drugs market is not going that well and their weapons sales are weak, the mafia decided to trigger a war between the USA and Russia. The best way is to make a fake attack on a random spot of New York. They needed to get close to someone and to kidnap him. But they need Blue alive to make him the perfect terrorist and use him in Russia to set more trouble. The only reason they gave Blue a tail job was to ensure that they were not discovered before the end of their plans.</p>
<p>But Blue is clever. The only way to stop these plans is to kill the three of them. To save his country, to save the world from a third world war, to be a hero… There is only one way. He knows it. As Brown is still speaking, Blue tries to put his hand in the back pocket of his pants. He must… reach… that… lighter… He can almost touch it. He puts a little more effort on it. He can now grab it. A tear is falling down his cheek, but Blue starts smiling. These little sparkles will be the end of everything. He will die as a hero but the world will never know.</p>
<p>This day, a little part of New York blew up but a global war was avoided.</p>
