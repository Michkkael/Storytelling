<p>In the borough of White, Blue decides to ring at each door to get more information about this particular person. The first person who opens their door is a very tall and stunning man, with a frightening appearance, but as soon as Blue pronounces the name of White, the man becomes intrigued and pushes back Blue by saying he doesn't know this man. Blue hasn’t expected this reaction, but he gets more and more disappointed when, door after door, he gets the same welcoming. None of the inhabitants agree to answer any question. Blue desperates, but finally decides to check the last shack, behind the hill, in front of the forbidden river. This place seems to be uninhabited, or abandoned for a long time but there is a legend which says one person lives there: Gray, the fish killer. Blue knocks at the door several times, without any answer. He shouts then: Is there anyone here? I’d like to speak about Mr White! Suddenly, the door is half-open, and someone is whispering: Come inside man, you are mad!</p>
<p>Blue enters a dark and moist room, where even moths don’t want to go. Blue finds himself in front of a stunted old man. He has a huge  long white beard and is wearing a decrepit hat. In the shack, there is only a worn rocking chair, a wobbly table next to the fireplace. Blue is engulfed by the horrible smell which mixes fish and smoke, but takes a sit on the rocking chair. The old man starts by lighting one pipe, and asks: What do you want to White?</p>
<p>Blue explains the whole story, without hiding anything. Gray is shocked and says: Oh, so he has started again. Blue is startled and asks for more details, starting by the identity of this old man. The man answers: I’m Gray, the fish killer, and White is my son…</p>
<p>Listen to that, it’s my life story. The old man starts. My wife, my two children, White, a nice and timid young guy, and Black, a turbulent but lovely one. We got here twenty-five years ago, it was a big change in our lives and we were very happy to start a new life here. It was a beautiful day, with a blue sky, birds were singing and there was a lot of other houses around us. One night, my sons were playing along the river. But suddenly, it was horrible, I just saw Black, my second son, falling into the water, and being bitten by the fishes in the river, those fucking truites, they were eating my Black! I hate this fish, I will kill every single truite of  this fucking forbidden river, he explains.</p>
<p>Blue is speechless, he has just got the information that he has been looking for but this is too big for him, and he doesn’t know what to think at the moment. White and Black are brothers, and one of them died in the river. But why has White asked Blue to investigate about Black, his dead brother? This question won’t stay without answer for long time, because White abruptly enters  the shack, carrying a gun in his hand.</p>
