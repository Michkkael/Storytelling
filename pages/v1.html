<h2>Tailing</h2>
<p>Long days pass without any suspicious act. The least we can say, Black is someone who seems banal at first. His clothes are casual, with a black suit, a black tie and a white shirt. He works in a small company in Manhattan and follows his daily routine like any random citizen.</p>
<p>For the first time in weeks, Blue is excited about this case, he will have something to write in his report, he has got some information about Black’s planning : Every now and then, Black goes to the restaurant with his co-workers but today’s meeting is labelled as “important” in Black’s diary.</p>
<p>Blue is telling himself that Black could be meeting White’s wife. It would make sense to Blue and maybe explain the whole point of this tail job.</p>
<p>Black’s behaviour is strange. He seems stressed and worried about something. Blue follows him and his co-workers throughout the whole city until Black enters “The Quill”: a famous restaurant down Fleet Street.</p>
<p>While Black is speaking to the waiter, his co-workers are sitting in red plush chairs discussing about what they will order.</p>
<p>While staying at a reasonable distance, Blue is keeping an eye on the whole scene. He sees someone heading towards Black’s table but he doesn’t recognize him. His face cannot be clearly seen in the darkness. He is tall, has a bowler hat and seems to be impressive. Moreover, they seem to be preparing a bad plan by getting closer and whispering. Gradually, Blue’s desire to know the identity of the mysterious man is growing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the mysterious person is turning over to the window and the private recognizes him … This man is Brown. Brown sees Blue. Blue is screwed.</p>
