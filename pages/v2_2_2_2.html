<h2>The double-personality</h2>
<p>Blue hesitates to tell the police about the acts of Black/White. He may be a single person with two personalities, White and Black. He would be a criminal with a burn-shaped cross on the neck. It’s foolish ! He doesn’t know how to call him. White? Black? He decides to call him White. With his information about White, Blue can’t call the police for denounce him. The detective thinks it’s a bad idea to continue to investigate on this mysterious man, but he is determined to resolve this enigma. First of all, Blue needs more information about this double personality. Why does White need this cover of Black? After a long day passed searching informations, Blue, finds something. White would be an important guy of the Irish Mafia. That’s why he needs this cover of double-personality.</p>
<p>Blue needs to confirm this information. He heads towards his car to go to White’s house. He really needs to confirm what he found a couple of hours ago. Blue thought  he would find White at his home and follow him like the other days. But White is not there. Blue utters an insult. It’s 7:00 am, usually White is at his office to work all day long. He is supposed to be back home at 12:00 am for lunch. Blue therefore decides to enter White’s home to find a proof of the statute of White in the Irish mafia. He is decided to solve this investigation. Blue goes to White’s garden to ensure that there is nobody inside the house. Apparently there is nobody. A window is slightly open but it’s two meters high. He jumps to catch the ledge and climbs on it. He just has to push the window and Blue has entered White’s house. There is a strange decoration with a lot of green and black. This is very sad. Blue thinks the green embodies the Ireland and the black is to hide himself. Blue is in the kitchen. He decides to search for the computer. He thinks it’s the best source of information. When Blue goes out of the kitchen the white replace the black but the green is still there. The double personality of White is present everywhere !</p>
<p>Blue goes through several rooms and finally sees his bedroom. A single bed and a wardrobe. that’s all no poster, nothing on the walls. Blue confirms his idea, White is a curious person. Finally Blue finds the office where White works at home. It’s 8:00 am. 4 hours left to find something. He sits down behind the desk when a noise reaches his ears. A noise of a car just in front of the house. Fear gets him. He stands up too fast and knocks over the chair. He has a quick look outside and sees, Brown and White together, coming out of the car. Stupefied, Blue can’t move and hears the door slam. In this room there is no way out. He run in the  corridor and goes back to the kitchen. He hears the two men near him, climbs the stairs quickly, maybe he is making too much noise. He accelerates and jumps outside by the same window that he entered, goes back to his car and leaves this house as quickly as possible. Blue decides to denounce White/Black or all the people he can be at the police and retire in Canada to never hear this story again.</p>
