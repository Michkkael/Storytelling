<p>Blue is feeling stunned and immediately gets out of his hiding spot to run away. Brown, seeing his student afraid of him, decides to catch him to explain the situation. Blue enters 5th avenue, which is crowded at the moment. As he is pushing people out of his way, he sees Brown is getting closer to him and can hear him screaming: “Blue, wait!”. In a run-up of panic, Blue steals a delivery-man’s scooter left alone into a sidewalk and dashes into the main street, slaloming between cars. As an immediate reaction, Brown waves at a Taxi and orders the driver to follow the scooter! Hurry up!  The taxi Driver looks at him seriously and says: Sorry, Sir, we are not into a movie, get out of my car right now. Brown is still determined and gets out of the taxi to jump onto a bike which happens to have been left unsupervised nearby.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Blue is slowed down by the traffic jam into 4th Avenue. Looking behind him, he sees Brown is catching up quickly. If he catches me, I’m done, Blue is thinking. He  manages to snake in and out between cars and trucks and gets onto the sidewalk, resuming his mad dash with more intensity. The pedestrians are protesting, yelling at him, deviating from the machine. Now Blue is out of reach from Brown.</p>
<p>While Blue is ending up in front of his house, he thinks he is safe now. He makes a foot on ground and heaves a long sigh of relief. He enters his house and shuts the door. I was waiting for you, Blue. Blue is on the verge of an heart attack as he sees Brown in front of him, seated into his own couch. Please, have a sit, keep calm and let me explain the meaning of this, Brown says. Blue is suspicious but he sits gently in front of Brown and says: Go on.</p>
