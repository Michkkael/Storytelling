<p>A lot of things are haunting Blue’s mind: What would a man like White hire me fo ? Is he scared of Black?  Is Black an important member of the Irish mafia? Why has he chosen me? They must have something against me, I didn’t even know there was an Irish mafia!</p>
<p>The truth is that despite the fact that Irish people seem to be the most friendly beer drinkers of the United Kingdom, their mafia is one of the most dangerous around the world. Brown says that he has no clue to help Blue in this case but Blue has to be prepared to hide himself and his family from this mafia whenever he can.</p>
<p>Blue thinks that maybe he should look for more information about the story of this organization. He decides to go to the headquarters of the UK Investigators Agency. That is the place where all the police and the private reports are located. Blue only went there once during his training. The atmosphere is really strange : the place where all the files are stored is an underground warehouse, the lights are so weak that we can barely read what’s written on the reports, it smells like every wall is rotten, the only thing we can hear beyond the footsteps is the disturbing silence. Blue is telling to himself that the man who works here must have become crazy.</p>
<p>Blue is searching, walking between the shelves opening some boxes, every two minutes he stops and looks around : he really feels he’s being observed. This loud environment makes Blue paranoiac. After two hours of scary research Blue can finally go. He gathers a bunch of files that may help him. Files, newspapers, reports, photos, books, … Blue’s night isn’t over, he has a lot of reading left to do. As he tries to understand the mafia by linking everything, his living room is becoming really messy. He can’t even walk properly into his own flat. This story is turning him crazy, he is tired, he needs more coffee.</p>
<p>It’s 5 AM now and Blue has been up all night and has still nothing related to Black or White but there is this photo. It’s a photo of several men with their children. The caption says “Irish mobsters and their sons - 1945”. Blue is thinking that these kids are going to become members of this mafia when they will grow up. It bothers him because something feels familiar to him  but he doesn't know what.</p>
<p>Finally Blue says to himself that he will find it tomorrow. As he lays into his bed, he keeps thinking about this picture. It’s on the tip of his tongue. He is slowly falling asleep. He is sure he knows something about this photo. He knows someone. When he suddenly wakes up, he has  found it. He looks victorious at first but his expression is quickly turning to horror. One of the children on the picture was Blue’s father.</p>
