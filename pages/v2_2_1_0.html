<h2>50 shades of blue</h2>
<p>Everything jostles in his head, Blue is lost. He hesitates between giving up this mission and keeping his quiet life or continuing his research, and finally understand probably his life’s story.</p>
<p>Blue hadn’t know his father. Blue’s mother always said his father, “Deep Blue”, was in the navie, and was saving the world. “Deep Blue, your father,  is a hero”, it was nice to hear it for a lonely child … But this picture forces him to review this whole issue. Blue takes a coffee, he add whiskey into the cup. He doesn’t seem fine. He calls his mother, completely drunk, and I prefer to don’t  speak about this hard discussion’s part to not chock the youngest among us. But in the end, Blue learned his father was a inhuman gangster and that now, he's in Chicago's prison.</p>
<p>At the moment when Blue would hanging, his mother say a valuable thing : “Your father is better in prison. With all his debts, he would already have died long ago.” His mother doesn’t know that but she's saying Blue is in danger of death. Without further delay, he takes his coat and go to the prison to meet Deep Blue, knowing it’s the only person who can help him, for once. With apprehension and after 6 hours in his car, he finally arrive to the prison. In the visit’s room, he looks for the men who's his father. He stares at every people present in the room, imagining it's his parent . He remember the only pictures that he got from him, two old photo stained with coffee and dirt. A person takes place in front of him. He introduced himself : “ I’m Deep Blue”. This voice paralyze Blue. He can’t speak, he can’t watch his father. After a long time, Blue explain the story, telling every details. He wants to understand and have help because he isn't sleeping at night, too  scared to close his eyes.</p>
<p>Deep Blue, surprised, reassures Blue, "the depts are payed". Deep Blue was in prison, and the gangster code say : “the only way to break a dept is the life’s sentence or death”, so Deep Blue payed. He thinks White probably wanted Blue to kill Black like Deep Blue normally did before. He doesn't know Blue wasn’t in Mafia, it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Now, Blue understood better than before. His father didn’t abandon him, he protected him. He sacrificed his life for Blue simply live. He didn’t made any mistakes, Deep Blue, his father, is a hero!</p>
