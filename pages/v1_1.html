<h2>An endless night</h2>
<p>What is his old mentor doing here, standing next to Black, the target so much talked about? 
Blue takes notes of this scene. He cannot hear through the pane but he sees Brown is talking to Black, making grand gestures. He seems in a panic. What he is talking about? How Brown can know black? If they are preparing a bad plan, why is Brown there ? Has Brown always been bad ?</p>
<p>On his way back, Blue realizes that he now has more questions about this case than before, while he was expecting answers. At the end of the night, in his bed, Blue can’t go to sleep. All this story keeps running through his mind. He smokes a cigarette, sees those images of Brown dealing with Black again. After a few hours walking into his apartment, Blue decides to get back to his office, which is also Brown’s former office to pursue his tail job.</p>
<p>While entering the room, Blue is frozen. Alone in the dark, he is expecting someone to jump out at him. He starts reading all the old archives directed by Brown, with all the names of the suspects, accomplices or just the witnesses, trying to find out a lead to Black, but without any success. He is spending his entire night into this room, convinced that he will find a clue. When the sun starts rising, Blue can’t stand this anymore and throws his whiskey’s glass across the office. It crushes into the cupboard’s big mirror which smashes into many pieces down onto the floor. Instead of feeling despondent, Brown is speechless. Just behind the broken mirror, there is a false bottom, holding a big file stamped “Confidential”. On the front of this file, a poor quality picture showing Black’s face.</p>
