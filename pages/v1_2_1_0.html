<h2>From the margins to the mainstream</h2>
<p>When Blue wakes up, he takes time remembering what has just happened, but he doesn’t know how much time he has spent sleeping. He is in a strange cellar, tied up to a chair. After a few minutes, as he is trying to free himself from his ropes, Brown appears in the room. I’m sorry for you, it’s so sad you have been meddling into this case, he says. Black appears in the cellar in his turn, in the company of a bald man with glasses, dressed up with a white coat. Blue knows that man, he’s an ex-scientist who gave Brown help in certain investigations during his work as a Private eye. His name is Green.</p>
<p>He understands Brown and Green are corrupted. But he doesn’t know that was the reason of their retirement. They decided to manage a sort of mafia, and Black is involved in. Brown gives a chance to Blue. He can decide to stop his investigation, keep his silence, and get free. Or he can decide to keep up with the investigation and stay locked up. Blue answers spitting on him. You don’t let me the choice, Brown announces. From a move of the head, he indicates the stairs to Green, and adds “Keep a close eye on him, Black”. Brown and Green disappear. Black, who hasn’t said anything suddenly goes to Blue and  releases him.</p>
<p>Blue doesn’t understand anything, especially when Black asks him to knock him out and to escape as quickly as possible. Blue doesn’t try to understand and executes Black’s request. He gives a violent hit on Black’s head and runs outside. The light is blinding, but he keeps running across the forest. Exhausted, he finally reaches a road. He manages stopping a truck and getting back into New York. Once arrived there, he gets to the police station, and tells them all the story.</p>
<p>A few weeks go on before Brown gets arrested,  then the lawsuit starts. Blue is part of civil action. Black too, because he happens to be a seeping secret agent. White is here too - his make-up removed - next to Brown, sat in the dock. He’s one of the managers of the mafia. That’s why he asked Blue to investigate on Black. All the team is present, except for Green, always wanted, and probably gone in a camping car according to the newspapers. The criminals are judged for trafficking in organized gangs. All the members are sentenced to prison, and Brown for twenty-five years, the longest sentence.</p>
<p>After the lawsuit, Black comes to Blue to explain he has prepared everything from the beginning, a long time ago, and to thank Blue for his unintentional cooperation. Since this day, Black and Blue have been working together on bigger cases, Brown  and White are behind bars, and Green probably produces methamphetamine in New-Mexico.</p>
