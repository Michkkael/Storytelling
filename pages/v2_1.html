<p>Of course not! Writing this in his report would show some lack of professionalism from Blue. Blues decides to meet Brown to get his opinion. Indeed, he doesn’t know what to do from now, he truly believes that his mission isn’t like the usual stuff he is used to working on.</p>
<p>A few hours later, he finally meets Brown at the “Simon’s Cafe”.</p>
<p>After a long conversation debating the case, Brown declares there are two ways to solve the situation. Either, Blue investigates about White to know who he is and why he is acting so oddly, or he keeps on doing his job without saying anything. And maybe gradually he will discover the whole truth about White.</p>
<p>Blue finally decides to investigate about White. He sends him his report in which he asks him for an appointment. The private has got an idea. He wants White to inform Black that Blue has information about Black, in order to trap them.</p>
<p>During their appointment White has a bad feeling. He thinks that Blue knows the whole truth about him and Black. They meet in a small alley. The kind of place we only see into movies: a dirty environment which is very dark, nobody is around, the stinky dustbins are covering the smell of White’s heavy makeup. White notices Blue’s behavior is unusual, he seems to be really self-confident. White is speaking fast, he’s making up a story to dodge Blue’s questions about Black, and to escape as soon as possible from this risky situation. It would be a shame if any connection between White and Black was revealed. Blue doesn’t learn anything from this conversation, but his misgivings about White are growing. It’s definitely not a marriage case and what he is about to discover might be some dangerous stuff. White tells him that he can’t stay because he must go back to work.</p>
<p>From now on, White will have to take care of this busybody Blue. The next email from White to Blue is containing a note saying that this is the last cheque he will have, White doesn’t need Blue’s services anymore.Blue thinks that White has discovered everything concerning his fake reports, which would explain why White has decided to fire him. Blue is now lost in his thoughts. He has to resume the whole investigation, to review the situation and take stock of the situation.
After hours and hours of reflexion he finally finds some schemer details, which confirm all his suspicions. That’s why he chooses to go and visit White’s neighbours’ to ask them a few questions.</p>
