<h2>The murderer river</h2>
<p>“Shut up old man ! My brother isn’t dead ! He’s alive ! I know it !” White says pointing a gun at his father. “And you, what are you doing here ? You’re in the house of my father ! Go away and forget all you know about me, black, and my father, Or I’ll shoot you !”. Distraught, Blue is trembling, he realises White is just crazy, and he misses his brother. But now, he’s dangerous, and now he has a weapon pointed at him.</p>
<p>Gray approaches slowly and says “Son, your brother is dead devoured by trouts!. You saw it I know, but, you need to accept this. You need to accept what really happened.”  And why I should trust you ? Tell me why ! White answers. Gray takes a deep breath and says with the most serious tone “Because I’m you’re father, White, and your brother is dead.”.</p>
<p>After one minute of silence, White drops his weapon, falls on his knees and cries “No ! No ! It’s impossible ! He was my best friend ! He was my other half! My unique brother !”</p>
<p>Blue, still here, is relieved. But he doesn’t know why White told him to investigate on Black. He asks this to his father Gray, who answers : “White was sad after the death of his brother, so he wanted to relive through himself as a schizophrenic”. </p>
<p>Blue doesn’t really understand what Gray means, but he nods anyway, and helps White to get up. White fixes Blue and says he’s sorry, and he regrets to drown Blue in this story, but he will still have to pay him for all he has done. On the furniture there are some pictures. He takes one of them and put it in front of Grey “Remember, Black and me were near the river there long time before the accident, we gave chicken legs to all these little fish anydays. We were inseparable.” I remember my son, I remember. It was the time your mother was alive. She disappeared near this river one day before this accident. Eaten by a hungry bear, because this animal was afraid of these trouts. “I didn’t know there were bears here ! “says Blue, anxious.</p>
<p>Gray shows his finger an old carpet with a bear head with a piece of handbag hooked at one of his teeth. “There was only one, but now it’s dead”. White takes his father in his arms and says “Dad, I would like to spend time with you, can I go fishing with you ?”. A tear appears on Gray’s face. “Sure my boy let’s go tomorrow. Mister Blue, we don’t need you anymore and thank you so much for your help.” No problem sir, I’ll go now, I need to explain all the situation to my mentor. Goodbye, It was nice to meet you. Two days later, at his office, Blue recieves a phone call. “ Hello, Brown ? What’s going on ? ” You worked for a Mr. White, isn’t it ? Yeah of course, but why ? What happened ? He recently called me to investigate a Mr. Gray..</p>
