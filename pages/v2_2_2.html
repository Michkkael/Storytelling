<p>As Blue is waiting for Brown to pick up the phone, he is spending a long time pacing back and forth in his office thinking about what White could be able to inflict him if White knows that Blue has elucidated the real signification of the scar. Finally, after a few minutes, Brown is picking up the phone and asks Blue what is going on to call him so late at night.</p>
<p>Blue relates him his case from the beginning, from why he accepted to work for White to his recent discoveries concerning his scar and his investment into drugs. Blue also tells him that he is the only one he can confide in because he trusts him. He doesn’t trust White anymore due to his last face to face with him. He felt that White is beginning to be more and more vicious, diabolic. Blue doesn’t forget the cruelty in his bloodshot eyes when Blue was asking questions about Black.</p>
<p>After his confessions, Blue is admitting that he hates feeling like this, that he is tired to try to fight to solve this case and that when he’s asleep all he is dreaming up for is White. White is beginning to be his main problem, Blue tends to forget Black’s case, he fears.</p>
<p>At the end of the conversation, Brown is advising Blue to be careful and to break off their agreement as fast as possible to prevent him to get some problem. White is a dangerous man who’s getting a brilliant knowledge of the “robber” of the city. In fact, Brown has already worked for White when he was younger. Unlike Blue he never discovered his real identity, he just knew that White was already a violent person, a drug trafficker.</p>
<p>Adding his ancient personal data to Blue’s information means that something has changed White’s behavior. For Brown, there is no more doubt. White is now an identity’s usurper and a manipulator who controls privates to get rid of them. That makes him even more dangerous and if Black and White are partners they will easily defeat any private, even Blue and do their drug’s sales as they wish. For Brown, White’s strategy consists into paying a private to work for him while he’s collecting information about him like where he lives, his home.</p>
<p>Despite Brown’s advice, Blue decides to keep on investigating on the case, he wants to know all the truth concerning White and Black. Even if he gets some precise ideas about their involvement he hopes to catch them together at the same time by doing their drug  business. It will enable him to evacuate his doubts about White’s scar and eventually warn the police.</p>
