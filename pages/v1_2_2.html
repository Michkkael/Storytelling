<p>The handshake is very strong and Blue feels something sharp in his hand. But Blue doesn’t pay attention to that, what he has learned is shocking him.</p>
<p>He locks the front door on the passage of Brown. While his mentor is leaving Blue’s house, Blue gazes at him. Brown is laughing at me, Blue thinks, I can’t believe that! Suddenly, Brown stands still. He turns his head and looks at Blue with a ferocious smile and a dark look. Blue knew it, this story is a lie.</p>
<p>Brown makes a U-turn and he goes back to Blue’s house. Blue feels that his right hand is warming up. His hand is painful and he has a powerful headache. He understands now that his own mentor is setting a trap for him and he is in danger. He is now paralysed, he can’t walk. The detective is looking for a hiding place or something to protect himself. Brown seems to want to go into the house. He knocks and says “Let me in, Blue, I have forgotten to do something very important. Let me in...”. His intonation is too stressful.  Blue is being introduced to Brown’s dark side for the first time. He is literally another man. He crawls onto the floor but gradually, he feels his legs solidify and movements are more and more difficult.</p>
<p>Two hours have passed, Blue is now laying, unconscious on the floor and Brown is still out there. Striking the door… He finally manages to get into the house. Now, he can take care of Blue, still unconscious.</p>
