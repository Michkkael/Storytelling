<h2>It's almost the end</h2>
<p>“Hands up, if you value your life” Blue and Gray are speechless and shocked. Blue looks his weapon in his holster, but White anticipates him and says in a derisive voice : “Don’t even think to it detective, to be a hero and to play the nosey parkers you put yourself in big trouble. You should have just investigated Black, no more !” Blue stay the most quiet possible to answer “ Please keep calm, I investigate Black, and I needed information. that’s why I came to meet your father. Now  the element which I don’t understand ; why you ask me to investigate into Black when he died 25 years ago ”. White becomes fury, and he shouts : “Black didn’t die !!”. Suddenly White’s face deforms, and his lips deform to an unrecognizable grin. Gray lets a hiccup escape of his mouth.</p>
<p>White take a hoarse voice “They say that I died but they’re wrong, I’m alive. Me the little renegade of the family. The bubby that everybody like.” shocked, he continue the monologue “Why, Why did you still take my place ? Why it’s you that people love? Since the accident of the river, Dad is preoccupied only of you.” “Because I am charismatic. And you, you still always the shy and fearful little boy, without big ambition.” “No ! No! No ! You lie !!! ”. While White is making his monologue, Blue searches a solution. He looks around and sees Gray petrified between horror and shock. To get out of here isn’t gonna be easy. A stroke of genius comes  his mind. And if he used White against Black. He calls out to Gray the most discreetly as possible, and asked him to trust him. The man anyway shocked by the situation agrees to a sign of the head.</p>
<p>“Hey Black ! What would make you think that Gray isn’t more proud of White than you ? It is to White that he still speaks, not to Black.” White, interrupted and surprised in its monologue, has a break. And with the voice of Black, starts again “ It’s not possible that my father prefers White to me. If not why he would want to kill quiet fishes of the river” “If your father wants to kill every fish in the river it’s because you died.” “No I’m not dead.” Gray begins to speak for the first time since White returned into the cabane. “Son, you die and I accept that. And even if  it saddens me, leave White alone.” White puzzled and surprised, he returned the weapon against him and shout. This is the end of Gray’s two sons.</p>
