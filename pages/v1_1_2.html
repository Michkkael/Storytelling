<h2>Troubled past</h2>
<p>Blue immediately opens the file. He discovers many photos, pieces of paper and scribbles. Among them, he notices a phone number encircled with red. Blue guesses that it’s Black’s phone number. Blue can’t believe what he’s seeing. Brown must have an obsession of Black, as he notices photos of him. Blue is looking for answers but he can’t find any. After hours of brain digging, Blue decides to go for a walk: He hasn’t left his office for 24 hours. As he’s crossing out the building’s door, a hand grabs his shoulder and reverts him. Blue sees Brown, looking exhausted. Brown says we have to discuss, I know you have many questions which need answers.</p>
<p>Blue, opening his office’s door, is afraid: His former mentor is now just a danger for him. Brown tells him to sit down and to listen, as he’s pouring himself a glass of Whisky. I know you know. I saw you're looking at Black and me yesterday. Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I don’t know what you are thinking, but this is certainly false, Brown says. The truth is that Black and me are associated. And that private detective job is a cover. Actually, when I was in this office, I used this job to launder money for big traficants and drug dealers, he goes on. Blue is speechless. But… Why?!, Blue asks, shouting. Why doing this? This job as a private detective, doesn’t make money enough. Laundering does. And does very well, Brown explains. And what is Black doing in this?, Blue asks. Black was my associate, he was dealing with the money part as I was dealing with the fake private part, Brown says. Wow… Blue says, That’s hard to hear… Now you have to answer my question: Who makes you follow Black? or me? Was it a guy named White?, Brown asks. Exactly, how do you know? Was White involved in your dirty mess?! Blue asks, blaming Brown. Don’t judge me! You don’t know how hard it was! I gave you this job! The least you can do is thanking me! Brown reproaches. Now listen carefully: White is probably hidding his face from you. That’s because we are related. White is my brother, Brown announces. What ? Blue is stunned. You heard me. White is my Brother. He and I used to make this money laundering before. But he wasn’t good at it. Black was our rival. He was just better at whitewashing than us. So my boss told us that we have to improve or we would be fired. Or worse… Brown says. So you contacted Black to partner up. Exactly. And white? You just sacked him? Blue asks. I had to as you can understand, Brown answers. I guess… So now what ? What should I tell him, Blue says. Tell him it’s over. You are no longer working for him. I’ll see. I don’t have to take any orders from you now, Blue says, obviously very angry. Make the right choice, Brown answers, but keep in mind that White is doing this from jalousie, Brown explains.</p>
<p>After one hour of hard talking, Brown leaves. Blue, astonished about Brown’s revelation, decides to write his report to White anyway. The appointment is scheduled at 4 PM in 5th Street. White will pick Blue up with his car, driven by a chauffeur.</p>
