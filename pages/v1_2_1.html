<p>February 15th, 2017</p>
<p>Today is a good day. It’s the wedding day! Orange is tired because last month she worked hard to organize the best wedding ever. The guests start arriving at the Belvedere Castle. Once everyone there, the ceremony begins. Raizinzin, the priest says: “If we meet here today, it is to marry this couple in holy matrimony. Weddings require people committed one to the other without being forced by anyone, promise to be faithful to each other for life and accept the responsibility of spouses. Is that how you hear it?” The spouses say Yes. The priest continues : “If anyone would oppose this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.” - MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ! The spouses turn around and see a man, standing a few meters from them, White, who has just shown up at their wedding.</p>
