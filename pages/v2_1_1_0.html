<p>You can check it, if you want to,Black indicates to Blue. Blue, worried, just makes a few steps around the huge pile of what seems to be cocaine and tells, with a voice of an hollywood mafioso, “it seems pretty good”. Black is now explaining to Blue how this dope is the finest in the entire country, how he’s giving a gift to you, Mr White, by selling at this price, that the dope will leave the country in a ship tomorrow... Blue is clearly afraid. He’s looking for a way to escape this situation and is no longer listening to Black’s instructions.”..... -ney….money!” Blue emerges: “What?” “Do you have the money!!” Black screams, losing his patience by repeating three times the same sentence. Blue is fixed, he didn’t expect this question. He tells Black, while stammering, that the money is in his car. Black answers that he will be waiting for him in this same room to celebrate this amazing sale. Blue leaves the room, a drop of sweat on his forehead, and sees the door getting closer to him as the heaven’s gates. Finally outside, he tells the waitress that he has to smoke. “No problem Mister Bl… White, excuse me.” Blue, still afraid, didn’t notice that weird sentence.</p>
<p>When he’s finally far enough from the house, Blue runs out to his car breathlessly. He opens the door and gets in the front seat. As he recovers from this situation, he begins to search for his possibilities. Either he drops that case and drives away, or he faces it. Blue, that novice private, will drive off that huge case? No, tells Blue to himself. That case is enormous. If I solve it, people will remember my name. I’ll face it, even if I have to put my life in danger. Therefore, He takes his gun, a beretta 9mm, out of the glove box and loads 7 bullets in it, ready to fight. He pulls himself out of his car and begins to walk to the house with a firm step. “Good cigarette, Mr White?” the waitress asks.  Blue opens the door without an answer and walks toward the room, jostling the crowd. Blue opens the room’s door. He discovers Mr White and Mr Black enjoying a bottle of Champagne, laughing. Mr White, seeing his former private, yells : “ SURPRISE!..” but he can’t finish his sentence : Blue, without any expression, shots five beautiful gold-plated bullets in Mr White’s body and points the gun towards Mr Black. Black’s face has changed, as a mask falling off. He yells at Blue : “STOP, don’t you see it’s Mr Brown??”. Blue is speechless. “This party is fake! The coke is just flour!  The same as to cover Brown’s Face, for not that you recognizes him! He did that fake case to prove that you’re a good private! Good enough to take his former desk! What have you done?!” Blue drops his gun, staggers before falling to the room’s wall without any face expression. His look is empty. Black is yelling at the crowd, now massed in the room, to call for an ambulance. Blue looks at the scene while his vision is blurring and his eyes are filling in tears.</p>
<p>Two weeks later. Rochester General Hospital. Blue, a bouquet of flowers in the head, is visiting Mr Brown, who miraculously survived Blue’s shooting. While Blue enters Brown’s room, he sees Mr Brown, eyes opened, looking at New York’s summer sky. Brown smiles as he turns his head to see Blue. “Luckily you don’t really know how to shoot” Brown says, a smile in his face. Blue, affected, returns his smile.</p>
