<p>In his office, Blue is gathering information about Black. But he doesn’t find anything in the database. He only has a few pieces of information from White, like his address. He jumps into his car and parks it in front of Black’s house and hides. He waits here during two hours before seeing a movement. He sees Black, in a large grey coat, getting out by the front door. He is walking into a shed next to his house and goes out, driving a sublime Chevrolet Camaro 450.</p>
<p>The tail job begins, Blue follows Black throughout the city. Finally Action ! He puts the the radio on and listens to pop music, it reminds him of his missions with Brown, Brown liked this music, he said that relaxed him during the tail job.</p>
<p>Black’s car isn’t difficult to track given that suddenly Black pulls out of the road and enters Johnson’s Market Parking. Blue does the same, staying not too close to Black so as not to get noticed. But Blue who is trying to be discreet, is loosing Black. In the parking lot, Blue is panicking as he doesn’t see Black’s car anymore. “Maybe he has already parked”,  Blue wonders. As he turns around the parking lot for the third time, Blue decides to park and look for for Black on the Market itself.</p>
<p>Johnson Market on saturday is full of people. As Blue is looking for Black, he is constantly on alert because any tall man reminds him of his target. After crossing about ten sections, he starts losing faith. As he walks to the exit, Blue doesn’t notice a man walking at him and jostling him violently. As he turns to apologize, the man is already far away. Immediately, Blue’s figuring out that this man is Black. And he particularly notices  a weird birth mark on the back of his neck and realizes this was exactly the same White had when he was in his office. Blue is speechless. The only thing he can do, is to stare at the man walking out of Johnson’s Market.</p>
<p>Blue feels still choked and is driving back to his office. When he starts writing his report, he is in a difficult and unusual situation. Does he have to explain all the story to White? Can he keep this secret and continue his investigation without giving any importance to that?</p>
