<h2>Revelation</h2>
<p>Blue is awakening, his eyes open slowly but it's hard for him to discern in the semi-darkness, the thin figure of a man in front of him. This silhouette is blurred. The figure is approaching Blue and starts talking to him. Despite this, Blue does not understand what he says, his hand itches and his ears whistle, he hears so chirps that he is curling up into a ball to cover his ears with his hands to try not to hear the whistles. Finally after a few minutes Blue recovers and manages to hear the voice speaking to him. Meanwhile, Brown comes closer and closer, he is approaching Blue with a determined step as he wanted to end up with something very important.</p>
<p>As Brown is getting closer Blue recognizes a familiar voice which is Brown’s voice. Brown is gripping Blue and begins to seize his forearm with a dry and brutal movement while dragging him to the nearest couch. Blue is still shocked and dazed. He is inoffensive and does not understand what is happening and despite his injuries and the fact that he no longer feels his legs he tries to struggle gesticulating in all directions, he thinks that Brown is going to kill him due to the offensive gaze Brown sent him.</p>
<p>However unlike what Blue thought, Brown isn’t trying to kill him. Seeing him shaking Brown tries to reassure him dealing that he isn’t going to hurt him. He also explains him that he just come back to his house because he wanted to end up the discussion they just had before and also because he forgot to tell him something very important.</p>
<p>Blue is finally waking up he feels his blood in his legs again and his right hand while he tries to position himself correctly on the couch. Brown is sitting down next to him and laying a hand on his shoulder saying that he would never have dared to hit him, all he did just now was to cripple him with a taser because he knew he would have not listened to his story. Brown explains him that when he left his house he thought.. about what he lived and what he felt through their missions. When he saw Blue in a difficult situation during their mission or when they were separated for a long time he felt a strange feeling seizing him... a feeling of love. It is from this point that he knew he was gay and that he liked men including Blue.</p>
<p>Blue does not believe his eyes, he is stunned about what Brown said! During all these years Brown was in love with him! Why is Brown telling him the truth? Why not earlier? Why not during their missions? Brown replies Blue by saying that he got this feeling for a very long time. He was his first love and that’s why he tried to protect him as he really cares for him during their mission. He many times tried to tell him the truth but he didn’t had the bravery to tell him. He feared that Blue would have ignored him no matter what and now he is with Black he wanted all the things to get clear hoping that it does not affect their friendship.</p>
