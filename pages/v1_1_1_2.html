<p>Blue enters Brown’s house. In this house he feels something abnormal. He has  bad feeling about this meeting … Blue stays alert to the situation. He pays attention to all of his gestures and especially to those of Brown. After Blue and Brown is sitting, Brown proposes a cup of coffee to Blue. At this moment, Blue loses his patience, and he stood up and looks for Brown, gives a punch at Brown. Brown is one more time surprised, but he says « Sorry Blue, Sorry, I am sitting down». Brown is horrified by Blue who seems really determined to tell fact from fiction. Brown says finally « I'll tell you everything if you let me the time and don't give me a another punch in my face ».</p>
<p>After a few minutes of a serious discussion, Brown solves the story for Blue. In reality, Brown says that two weeks ago he fixes a meeting with Black and/or White to talk about his problems. He says to Blue he did this to help him. Because at this period Blue couldn't find clues in the investigation of Black or/and White. Brown considers Black as a dangerous man. That's why he has decided to make an appointment with White. Brown understood one thing at this appointment as White has a big problem. Blue begins to understand. But he doesn’t understand why Brown doesn’t talk about this appointment to him. And that's when Brown says to Blue that he hasn't talked about this appointment to protect him to this dangerous person. For him this person is very dangerous and we can't know what he is capable. Blue understood at last. But he his very disappointed because for him Brown is his mentor and a mentor has to work with his colleague. Blue has done everything for nothing… Brown stands up and looks friendly Blue and he holds out his hand and forgive his behaviour. Brown says to Blue « If we end the investigation together, as in the good old days.” Blue stands up and shake Brown’s hand, watching him in the eyes and saying to him « As in the good times ».</p>
<p>At this moment White is in a real crisis of schizophrenia and enters the living room with a gun. Brown and Blue are very surprised of his behaviour, and wonder how does he know the location of Brown’s house..? No matter what. Black looks Brown and Blue and he puts the gun on his face. He is in tears. « You failed your mission, I've contacted you to get better, to make friends... » At the very last moment Brown’s wife arrives from the back of the living room and grabs Black suddenly from the back. The gun falls on the ground.</p>
