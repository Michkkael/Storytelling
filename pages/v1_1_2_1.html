<p>One hour before the appointment, Blue puts his jacket with a mechanical gesture. The revelations still haunted him. Brown has always been an example in Blue’s life. An excellent detective, doing his job humbly, but efficiently. Since Blue knew him, Brown has never accepted a single bribe and he has always vehemently  denied corruption. And now… now, Blue sees Brown’s real face. Trafficker, outlaw with no regret. Because of his cowardice, Brown was in fact the worst enemy of Blue. The door slam behind him with a thunderous noise. The wind roars down the street that Blue takes. The 5th Street. The noise of the city troubles Blue’s reflection. What should he do ? Brown betrayed his trust, but White wasn’t a good men either. He could certainly call the police, and denounce them all, but where would it lead him ? Brown’s boss might want his death. And I don’t want to die today, Blue thinks. At this moment, a long black car stops near the sidewalk. The rear door opens and White rises from his seat.</p>
<p>Ah, Mr Blue ! Nice to see you, White says. I'm sorry for the delay, but today, my driver has taken longer than expected to get to work. This is his first time, so you understand… Oh there is no problem, Mr White, Blue answers with a little smile. White also smiles, but his eyes doesn’t give the same impression. Cold, gray, hard. Blue fears those eyes, and he shudders when White’s smile disappears. Come, Mr Blue. We have to talk, White proclaims. Blue hesitates. He has no desire to get into White’s car. Because, he knows how much the situation is dangerous. He finally settles on the left rear seat. White is next to him. He smiles… So, how's your case with my friend ... Black ? White asks. Mr White, please, listen to me, Blue says. The case is over. I am no longer working with you. White seems surprised and there is anger in his eyes now. He asks why and Blue explains : he has a big problem with another case and he cannot spend more time on other cases. Suddenly, White stays silent for a moment. The car stops in an empty parking lot and time seems to stand still. Something has wrong and Blue knows it before White laughs. Are you sure, Mr Blue, that is not your conversations with Brown who made you changed your mind ? Blue tries to keep his calm, but he shakes despite himself. How ? How did White know that ? White gets out a recorder from his pocket and shows it to Blue. Blue hears with horror the conversation he just had with Brown, three hours ago. Yes, White says. There were informers in your office. Strange is not it ? How this small file managed to tell me more than you about your own investigation on Mr Black and my brother.</p>
<p>This time, it is a gun that White gets out of his pocket. Yes, your case is over Blue, and your life with it, White says with a terrifying smile. A shot rings out in the car, but it is not the blood of Blue flowing over the chair.  Blue sees a pure expression of surprise on White’s face. His eyes close and his body collapses on the rear deck. Blue turns around and recognizes, with astonishment, the driver. Mr Black ?! Blue exclaims.</p>
<p>Suddenly, five police cars arrive in the parking and the sound of their siren sounds in Blue’s head. No, it’s Mr FBI, my friend, Mr Black says. Sorry for not having said anything during my investigation, but I had to be sure that Brown would not notice anything. So you’re not a criminal ? Blue asks. No, Black answers. But Brown is one of them. Come Mr Blue. it’s over now. Everything is over.  Still surprised to be alive, Blue goes out of the car, promising to never investigate in his life anymore.</p>
