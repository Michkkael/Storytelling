<h2>Bad revelations</h2>
<p>After a hard night writing his report, Blue is sleeping into his leather armchair. The coffee failed at his mission: keeping him wide awake. The day has barely risen when the phone starts ringing, loudly in his ears. He answers the phone with difficulty, and hears the familiar voice of his secretary. He asks her what she wants, hoping to get rid of her quickly. Yesterday was long and Blue’s attention is already focused on a worrying subject. Mr White is in the waiting room and he would like to see you, she tells him. Blue panics, loses its means and begins stammering: Yes..., yes let him in, yes,  Blue says in a confused voice. After hanging up, Blue starts tidiyng up his office which is not in condition to receive a client. Without wasting time, he clears up papers and cleans the stains of coffee.  He feels stressed and he has many questions and interrogations. What is White doing here?</p>
<p>Hello Mr Blue, it’s a good day to live, White says while closing the door behind him. Blue allows himself a half smile. He invites White to sit. The detective’s eyes never leave White’s face. There is always an unknown element in a case. But here, the unknown is the case itself. And Blue feels determined to come to solve this case. While Blue offers a cup of coffee to White who asks him how the case is going.  Although he’s nervous, Blue answers calmly: the tail hasn’t revealed anything so far. He needs more time to finish the case. Suddenly, their eyes cross. Blue shudders despite him. White’s look is not friendly anymore, and the atmosphere is getting cold into the office. However, their discussion is cordial, and ends with a polite handshake. But Blue doesn’t forget the cruelty in his client’s bloodshot eyes. Something has changed in White’s attitude when Blue spoke to him about Black. As White is leaving the room, Blue realises White’s birthmark isn’t a birthmark but the scar of a burn mark, the shape of a cross. Who would inflict such a mark on someone’s neck? Blue has no idea but he feels that this case is becoming darker.  As he is pondering about the amazing shape of the burn mark, Blue decides to conduct more research. After a long time, he discovers that the cross-shaped burn mark is the result of a punishment in the Irish mafia.</p>
<p>After that, he calls a friend working at the CIA and asks him to try to find out more about White. What his friend is revealing him is terrifying; he describes White as a wicked man, able to kill, kidnap and torture anyone just for his own interest. Blue is completely at a loss and terrified. He’s calling Brown to tell him about his discoveries... Blue seems to be in trouble...</p>
