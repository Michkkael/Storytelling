Storytelling - MMI
==================

What you are about to experience is a project carried on by multimedia students from IUT1 Joseph Fourier university in Grenoble. They were given the first page of Paul Auster’s short-story “Ghosts” from the New York Trilogy (1987) and were asked to imagine what happens next.
Each chapter will lead you to two possible continuations. From now on, the choice is yours.
